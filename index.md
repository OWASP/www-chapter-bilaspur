## Welcome to OWASP Bilaspur

The **OWASP Bilaspur Chapter** is part of the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP), a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.  

Our mission is to build a strong local community of students, professionals, and enthusiasts who are passionate about **application security, cybersecurity awareness, and secure software development**.  

We organize **meetups, workshops, and technical talks** to share knowledge, learn from experts, and collaborate on open security projects.  

👉 Join our community on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-bilaspur-chapter/) to stay updated on upcoming events.
